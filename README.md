# MNIST-Neural-Network

The NN is using the MNIST Data set of hand drawn digits to use a way to display how a NN works on a more detailed scale.
The math shows how the model can calculate up to 85% in the initial version.
The 2nd version adds an additional layer (convolutional layer) to further improve the base NN.
